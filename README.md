"ClassMaps is a web application that gives Princeton students and easy way to find the location of their classes, as well as other resources and places on campus. The current methods of doing this are limited and decentralized. Normally, students have to go through a two step process of searching for a class on course offerings, and then looking up the location on Google or Princeton map, but ClassMaps bridges those two steps into a singular process. ClassMaps will give Princeton students a platform to quickly see where and when classes of interest meet. 
 
The basic user interface of the map with show an interactive map of the campus, with a search bar on the top and controls to interact with the map on the bottom right hand corner. Students can search for courses and buildings by typing in the search bar and refine their results by setting filters. The results with show live on the same page and selecting them will take you directly to the location on our map, with a popup stating detailed information on the item.
 
Unlike previous course offering projects which are used primarily during course selection, we envision ClassMaps to be used even after sporadically to find event locations, resources, and other precepts. However, we primarily target ClassMaps at underclassmen, and for use during the first couple weeks of classes when people need to remember where their classes are."
